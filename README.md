# 🧠 BrainOutAI

**Making simple questions unnecessarily complicated since 2024**

BrainOutAI is a hilarious web application that takes your simple questions and transforms them into absurdly over-complicated, technically accurate explanations. Ask "What's 2+2?" and get a PhD-level dissertation on discrete mathematics and quantum superposition!

## ✨ Features

- 🤓 **Over-Engineering Everything**: Transforms simple questions into complex academic explanations
- 🔥 **Make It Even Harder**: Button to make answers even more ridiculously complicated
- 🎭 **Random Memes**: Fun popup with random memes for first-time visitors
- 📋 **Copy Responses**: Easy copying of AI responses to share the absurdity
- 📱 **Mobile Responsive**: Works perfectly on all devices
- 🌙 **Dark Theme**: Beautiful ChatGPT-inspired dark interface
- ⚡ **Real-time Chat**: Smooth chat experience with loading animations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- A Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up your environment:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` and add your Gemini API key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here
   PORT=3001
   ```

3. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3001

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Ask any simple question** - "What's 2+2?", "How do I make coffee?", etc.
2. **Get an over-complicated answer** - Complete with quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and unnecessary mathematical proofs
3. **Make it even harder** - Click the "Make It Even Harder!" button for maximum absurdity
4. **Copy and share** - Share the hilarious responses with friends

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Express.js + Node.js
- **AI**: Google Gemini API
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with ChatGPT-inspired design

## 🎨 Example Interactions

**User:** "What's 2+2?"

**BrainOutAI:** "To determine the sum of two discrete integer units and two additional discrete integer units, we must first establish our mathematical framework within the Peano axiom system. Consider the thermodynamic implications of numerical addition in a closed system where entropy remains constant..."

**User:** *clicks "Make It Even Harder!"*

**BrainOutAI:** "Ah, but we must delve deeper into the quantum mechanical foundations of arithmetic operations. In the Hilbert space of mathematical consciousness, the superposition of numerical states requires a comprehensive analysis of the wave function collapse during the observation of summation..."

## 🔧 Development

- `npm run dev` - Start both frontend and backend in development mode
- `npm run client` - Start only the frontend
- `npm run server` - Start only the backend
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
